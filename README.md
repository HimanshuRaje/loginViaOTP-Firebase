# 📱 Firebase OTP Login (Test Mode)

This is a React-based OTP login system using Firebase Phone Authentication — built for learning purposes.

⚠️ **Important Note**  
This OTP Login system uses Firebase Phone Authentication in test mode.(the firebase logic is commented and firebase apiKey is hashed for security purpose)
It only works with pre-configured test numbers (like `+919999999999`) for development purposes.  
**Billing was not enabled** to avoid any risk of real-world charges.  
This project was created for **learning and practice only**.
